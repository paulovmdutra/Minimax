# Description
An implementation of Minimax AI Algorithm on Tic-Tac-Toe. Made using Python. The artificial intelligence (AI) uses the minimax algorithm to found out the winner strategy. 
The minimax is an AI applied in two-player games. The algorithm search, recursively, the best move.
In this repository, I made the game tic-tac-toe that
simulates both players: Human, and computer. If you wish, you can change the code for allowing the a real human to play with the computer
